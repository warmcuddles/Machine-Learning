    "Some algorithms can deal with partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unlabeled \n",
    "data and a little bit of labeled data. This is called semisupervised learning.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Some photo-hosting services, such as Google Photos, are good examples of this. Once\n",

    "same person A shows up in photos 1, 5, and 11, while another person B shows up in\n",

    "  \n",
    "Most semisupervised learning algorithms are combinations of unsupervised and\n",
    "supervised algorithms. For example, deep belief networks (DBNs) are based on unsu‚Äê\n",
    "pervised components called **restricted Boltzmann machines** (RBMs) stacked on top of\n",

With this technique, you can train your pet to do ‚Äúgood‚Äù deeds when required.   \n",

    "* The treat becomes the reward function\n",
    "* The good behavior is the resultant action  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The above example explains what reinforcement learning looks like. This is actually a classic example of reinforcement learning.    \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a very different beast. The learning system, called an agent\n",
    "in this context, can observe the environment, select and perform actions, and get\n",
    "rewards in return (or penalties in the form of negative rewards). It\n",
    "must then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a policy, to get the most\n",
    "reward over time. A policy defines what action the agent should choose when it is in a\n",

    "  \n",
    "![](img/rl.png)  \n",

    "Learning: it made the headlines in March 2016 when it beat the world champion Lee\n",
    "Sedol at the game of Go. It learned its winning policy by analyzing millions of games,\n",
    "and then playing many games against itself. Note that learning was turned off during\n",
    "the games against the champion; AlphaGo was just applying the policy it had learned.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "# 2. Batch and Online Learning\n",
    "Another criterion used to classify Machine Learning systems is whether or not the\n",
    "system can learn incrementally from a stream of incoming data.  \n",
    "### Batch learning\n",
    "In batch learning, the system is incapable of learning incrementally: it must be trained\n",
    "using all the available data. This will generally take a lot of time and computing\n",
    "resources, so it is typically done offline. First the system is trained, and then it is\n",
    "launched into production and runs without learning anymore; it just applies what it\n",
    "has learned. This is called **offline learning**.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "If you want a batch learning system to know about new data (such as a new type of\n",
    "spam), you need to train a new version of the system from scratch on the full dataset\n",
    "(not just the new data, but also the old data), then stop the old system and replace it\n",
    "with the new one.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Fortunately, the whole process of training, evaluating, and launching a Machine\n",
    "Learning system can be automated fairly easily, so even a batch learning system can adapt to change. Simply update the data and train a new\n",
    "version of the system from scratch as often as needed.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This solution is simple and often works fine, but training using the full set of data can\n",
    "take many hours, so you would typically train a new system only every 24 hours or\n",
    "even just weekly. If your system needs to adapt to rapidly changing data (e.g., to pre‚Äê\n",
    "dict stock prices), then you need a more reactive solution.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Also, training on the full set of data requires a lot of computing resources (CPU,\n",
    "memory space, disk space, disk I/O, network I/O, etc.). If you have a lot of data and\n",
    "you automate your system to train from scratch every day, it will end up costing you a\n",
    "lot of money. If the amount of data is huge, it may even be impossible to use a batch\n",
    "learning algorithm.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Finally, if your system needs to be able to learn autonomously and it has limited\n",
    "resources (e.g., a smartphone application or a rover on Mars), then carrying around\n",
    "large amounts of training data and taking up a lot of resources to train for hours\n",
    "every day is a showstopper.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "Fortunately, a better option in all these cases is to use algorithms that are capable of\n",
    "learning incrementally.  \n",
    "### Online learning\n",
    "Online learning methods work in a different way as compared to batch learning methods. The training\n",
    "data is usually fed in multiple incremental batches to the algorithm. These data batches are also known as\n",
    "mini-batches in ML terminology. However, the training process does not end there unlike batch learning\n",
    "methods. It keeps on learning over a period of time based on new data samples which are sent to it for\n",
    "prediction. Basically it predicts and learns in the process with new data on the fly without have to re-run the\n",
    "whole model on previous data samples.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "There are several advantages to online learning‚Äîit is suitable in real-world scenarios where the model\n",
    "might need to keep learning and re-training on new data samples as they arrive. Problems like device failure\n",
    "or anomaly prediction and stock market forecasting are two relevant scenarios. Besides this, since the data\n",
    "is fed to the model in incremental mini-batches, you can build these models on commodity hardware\n",
    "without worrying about memory or disk constraints since unlike batch learning methods, you do not need\n",
    "to load the full dataset in memory before training the model. Besides this, once the model trains on datasets,\n",
    "you can remove them since we do not need the same data again as the model learns incrementally and\n",
    "remembers what it has learned in the past.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "One of the major caveats in online learning methods is the fact that bad data samples can affect the\n",
    "model performance adversely. All ML methods work on the principle of ‚ÄúGarbage In Garbage Out‚Äù. Hence\n",
    "if you supply bad data samples to a well-trained model, it can start learning relationships and patterns that\n",
    "have no real significance and this ends up affecting the overall model performance. Since online learning\n",
    "methods keep learning based on new data samples, you should ensure proper checks are in place to\n",
    "notify you in case suddenly the model performance drops. Also suitable model parameters like learning\n",
    "rate should be selected with care to ensure the model doesn‚Äôt overfit or get biased based on specific data\n",
    "samples  \n",
    "  \n",
    "# 3. Instance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning\n",
    "One more way to categorize Machine Learning systems is by how they generalize.\n",
    "Most Machine Learning tasks are about making predictions. This means that given a\n",
    "number of training examples, the system needs to be able to generalize to examples it\n",
    "has never seen before. Having a good performance measure on the training data is\n",
    "good, but insufficient; the true goal is to perform well on new instances.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "There are two main approaches to generalization: instance-based learning and\n",
    "model-based learning.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Instance-based learning\n",
    "There are various ways to build Machine Learning models using methods that try to generalize based\n",
    "on input data. Instance based learning involves ML systems and methods that use the raw data points\n",
    "themselves to figure out outcomes for newer, previously unseen data samples instead of building an explicit\n",
    "model on training data and then testing it out.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "A simple example would be a K-nearest neighbor algorithm. Assuming k = 3, we have our initial training\n",
    "data. The ML method knows the representation of the data from the features, including its dimensions,\n",
    "position of each data point, and so on. For any new data point, it will use a similarity measure (like cosine or\n",
    "Euclidean distance) and find the three nearest input data points to this new data point. Once that is decided,\n",
    "we simply take a majority of the outcomes for those three training points and predict or assign it as the\n",
    "outcome label/response for this new data point. Thus, instance based learning works by looking at the input\n",
    "data points and using a similarity metric to generalize and predict for new data points  \n",
    "  \n",
    "![](img/ib.png)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Model-based learning\n",

    "1. How would you define Machine Learning?  \n",
    "> Machine Learning is about building systems that can learn from data. Learning\n",
    "means getting better at some task, given some performance measure.\n",
    "2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?  \n",
    "> (By User)\n",
    "3. What is a labeled training set?  \n",
    "> A labeled training set is a training set that contains the desired solution (a.k.a. a\n",
    "label) for each instance.\n",
    "4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?\n",
    "> regression and classification.\n",
    "5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "> Common unsupervised tasks include clustering, visualization, dimensionality\n",
    "reduction, and association rule learning\n",
    "6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to\n",
    "walk in various unknown terrains?  \n",
    "> Reinforcement Learning \n",
    "7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple\n",
    "groups?  \n",
    "> If you don‚Äôt know how to define the groups, then you can use a clustering algo‚Äê\n",
    "rithm (unsupervised learning) to segment your customers into clusters of similar\n",
    "customers. However, if you know what groups you would like to have, then you can feed many examples of each group to a classification algorithm (supervised\n",
    "learning), and it will classify all your customers into these groups.  \n",
    "8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning prob‚Äê\n",
    "lem or an unsupervised learning problem?  \n",
    "> supervised learning problem\n",
    "9. What is an online learning system?  \n",
    "> An online learning system can learn incrementally, as opposed to a batch learn‚Äê\n",
    "ing system. This makes it capable of adapting rapidly to both changing data and\n",
    "autonomous systems, and of training on very large quantities of data.\n",
    "10. What is out-of-core learning?\n",
    "> Out-of-core algorithms can handle vast quantities of data that cannot fit in a\n",
    "computer‚Äôs main memory. An out-of-core learning algorithm chops the data into\n",
    "mini-batches and uses online learning techniques to learn from these minibatches.\n",
    "11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predic‚Äê\n",
    "tions?  \n",
    "> An instance-based learning system learns the training data by heart; then, when\n",
    "given a new instance, it uses a similarity measure to find the most similar learned\n",
    "instances and uses them to make predictions\n",
    "12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm‚Äôs\n",
    "hyperparameter?  \n",
    "> A model has one or more model parameters that determine what it will predict\n",
    "given a new instance (e.g., the slope of a linear model). A learning algorithm tries\n",
    "to find optimal values for these parameters such that the model generalizes well\n",
    "to new instances. A hyperparameter is a parameter of the learning algorithm\n",
    "itself, not of the model (e.g., the amount of regularization to apply).\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common\n",
    "strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?   \n",
    "> Model-based learning algorithms search for an optimal value for the model\n",
    "parameters such that the model will generalize well to new instances. We usually\n",
    "train such systems by minimizing a cost function that measures how bad the sys‚Äê\n",
    "tem is at making predictions on the training data, plus a penalty for model com‚Äê\n",
    "plexity if the model is regularized. To make predictions, we feed the new\n",
    "instance‚Äôs features into the model‚Äôs prediction function, using the parameter values found by the learning algorithm.\n",
    "14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?\n",
    "> Some of the main challenges in Machine Learning are the lack of data, poor data\n",
    "quality, nonrepresentative data, uninformative features, excessively simple mod‚Äê\n",
    "els that underfit the training data, and excessively complex models that overfit\n",
    "the data.\n",
    "15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new\n",
    "instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?   \n",
    "> . If a model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new\n",
    "instances, the model is likely overfitting the training data (or we got extremely\n",
    "lucky on the training data). Possible solutions to overfitting are getting more\n",
    "data, simplifying the model (selecting a simpler algorithm, reducing the number\n",
    "of parameters or features used, or regularizing the model), or reducing the noise\n",
    "in the training data.\n",
    "16. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?\n",
    "> A test set is used to estimate the generalization error that a model will make on\n",
    "new instances, before the model is launched in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What is the purpose of a validation set?\n",
    "> A validation set is used to compare models. It makes it possible to select the best\n",
    "model and tune the hyperparameters.\n",
    "18. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?\n",
    "> If you tune hyperparameters using the test set, you risk overfitting the test set,\n",
    "and the generalization error you measure will be optimistic (you may launch a\n",
    "model that performs worse than you expect).\n",
    "19. What is cross-validation and why would you prefer it to a validation set?\n",
    "> Cross-validation is a technique that makes it possible to compare models (for\n",
    "model selection and hyperparameter tuning) without the need for a separate vali‚Äê\n",
    "dation set. This saves precious training data."
