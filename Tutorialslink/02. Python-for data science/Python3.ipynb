    "# CHAPTER1. NATIVE DATATYPES\n",
    "let’s talk about datatypes. In Python, every\n",
    "value has a datatype, but you don’t need to declare the datatype of variables. How does that work? Based\n",
    "on each variable’s original assignment, Python figures out what type it is and keeps tracks of that internally.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Python has many native datatypes. Here are the important ones:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "1. **Booleans** are either True or False.\n",
    "2. **Numbers** can be integers (1 and 2), floats (1.1 and 1.2), fractions (1/2 and 2/3), or even complex numbers.\n",
    "3. **Strings** are sequences of Unicode characters, e.g. an HTML document.\n",
    "4. **Bytes** and byte arrays, e.g. a JPEG image file.\n",
    "5. **Lists** are ordered sequences of values.\n",
    "6. **Tuples** are ordered, immutable sequences of values.\n",
    "7. **Sets** are unordered bags of values.\n",
    "8. **Dictionaries** are unordered bags of key-value pairs.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Of course, there are more types than these. Everything is an object in Python, so there are types like\n",
    "module, function, class, method, file, and even compiled code  \n",
